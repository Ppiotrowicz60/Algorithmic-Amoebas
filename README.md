# Interview Environment Setup Guide

This guide will assist you in preparing the environment for an interview involving an Angular frontend and a .NET 8 minimal Web API backend. Follow these steps carefully to ensure everything runs smoothly.

## 🚀 Prerequisites 

### .NET 8 SDK
✅ Download and install the .NET 8 SDK from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0).

### Angular 18
✅  Follow the guide to get started with Angular 18 [here](https://material.angular.io/guide/getting-started).

### IDE/Editor Configuration
🔧 Configure your preferred IDE (Visual Studio 2022, VS Code, Rider, etc.) to work with both C#/.NET 8 and Angular. Ensure you have the necessary plugins and extensions installed.

## 🧬 Backend Setup (C# .NET 8 Web API)

1. **Navigate to the API directory:**
   ```sh
   cd .\src\api\
   ```

2. **Restore the .NET dependencies:**
   ```sh
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Run the Web API:**
   ```sh
   dotnet run
   ```

   This will start the Web API at `http://localhost:5000`, and the **🌐 Swagger UI** will be available at `http://localhost:5000/swagger/index.html`.

4. **Verify the API:**
   Use the provided `.http` file to ensure the API is running and responsive:
   ```sh
   .\src\api\api.http
   ```

## 🌈 Frontend Setup (Angular 18)

1. **Navigate to the client directory:**
   ```sh
   cd .\src\client\
   ```

2. **Install the Node.js dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Serve the Angular application:**
   ```sh
   ng serve
   ```

   This will run the Angular app at `http://localhost:4200/`.

4. **Verify the Frontend:**
   Ensure that the frontend properly consumes the API. A button has been prepared in `app.component.html` to test the API call.

   Clicking the 👆 **[Call API]** button should trigger the API call and display the results dynamically.

> **Example Data from API:**
> ```json
> [
>   "Tokyo",
>   "Delhi",
>   "Shanghai",
>   "Sao Paulo",
>   "Mumbai",
>   "Beijing",
>   "Cairo",
>   "Dhaka",
>   "Mexico City",
>   "Osaka",
>   "Karachi",
>   "Chongqing",
>   "Istanbul",
>   "Buenos Aires",
>   "Kolkata",
>   "Lagos",
>   "Kinshasa",
>   "Manila",
>   "Tianjin",
>   "Guangzhou"
> ]
> ```

By following these steps, you should have a fully functional environment for the interview. Ensure everything is working as expected before the interview begins.
